# Interval_Count
Interval counter in Javascript for WEB projects

---

This repository contains a script that is a modification of the **Countdown Time** script provided by *w3schools*.

This new script makes it possible to view remaining session time and idle time.

The original script was modified and saved in this project in the "assets" folder with the name interval_count.js.

In that folder there is also another file, otherscripts.js, with a date format conversion function for tests and visualizations according to some projects in this repository.

# Examples
Some usage examples are also available:

- **HTML_Projects\Interval_Count folder**:
> - contains 2 html files as examples of applicability (index1.html, index2.html)
> - copy from **Assets** folder
> 
> **Note:** *I recommend using the Mozila Firefox browser, because between it and other browsers I tested (Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome) it was the one I got a satisfactory result of viewing this test directly in the html.*
